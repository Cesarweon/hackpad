# ButtonBlaster-Macropad
![Modelo](https://github.com/Cesarweon/ButtonBlaster-Macropad/blob/main/Images/Armado.png)

## Inspiration
My inspiration for my macropad was a keyboard I once saw on the internet; it only had the essential keys for playing shooter video games.

## Challenges
My biggest challenge was making the traces on the PCB; I always ended up with no way to connect some components because I didn't have good organization.
